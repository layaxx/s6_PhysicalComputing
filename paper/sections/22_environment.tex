\subsection{Environment}
\label{subsec:environment}

For this project, the breadboard, on which the arduino and both sensors are connected, is mounted on a swivel plate.
This allows the for easy and smooth rotation.
The board should be mounted in a way that puts the ultrasound sensor close to its center of rotation.

To create the types of junctions that have to be classified, I created two L shaped pieces, consisting of two planks of wood each, joined in a $90\deg$ angle.
Those two are sufficient to create every relevant type of environment.
