\subsection{Arduino}
\label{subsec:arduino}

As stated previously, the code that controls the arduino is written in C.
Its purpose is to configure the sensors, monitor them for new data and relay that to the Laptop when available.
Communication with the MPU6050 sensor happens via the Inter-Integrated Circuit (\IIC) protocol.
Communication with the laptop uses a serial connection via USB at a BAUD rate of 19200.


The main control logic for the micro controller is quite simple. Upon startup, all ports and sensors are configured.
Then, a infinite loop is started, which relays sensor data to the laptop if a new value is available.
Availability of new sensor data is determined via interrupts.
