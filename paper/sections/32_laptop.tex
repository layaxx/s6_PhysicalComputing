The reasons I choose Typescript for the Laptop-side software are that this is the language I have the most experience with and that, when used in the context of a webapp, it facilitates easy visualization of data.
This is especially helpful for debugging, but comes at the price of performance, which I assume is lower than what can be achieved with other languages such as C.

\paragraph{Proxy}
Because a webapp cannot directly access the serial port, I wrote a proxy script, which reads from the serial port and provides received data via the WebSocket protocol.
