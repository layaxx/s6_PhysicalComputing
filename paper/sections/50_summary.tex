\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

This paper describes the process of building a platform for distinguishing x junctions, t junctions and corridors via a gyroscope and a ultrasonic distance sensor.
Turns of the platform are reliably detected via a state machine.
Upon detection, data that has been recorded during the rotation is used to compare the scan of the environment against previously recorded data, thus allowing a classification.
