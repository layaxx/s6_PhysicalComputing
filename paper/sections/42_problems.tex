\paragraph{Distances >= 2m}
Distances of 2 meters or above are sometimes recognized as 1m. I do not know why this is, and it mostly works again after a reset. 16 Bit Clock time of arduino should allow for distances of up to about 5.5 meters, which is well above the maximum distance of the ultrasonic sensor, which is 4 meters.
