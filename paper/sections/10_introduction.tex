\section{Introduction}
The following paper describes an arduino based system capable of distinguishing types of junctions via ultrasound.

The problem has been touched upon in \cite{article}. For this project, the focus lies on classification of the environment into corridor, X-Junction or T-Junction. Classification is performed after capturing distance measurements during a $180\deg$ turn of the arduino platform from left to right.

Quick note about Terminology: Unlike \cite{article}, angles will be used from $0\deg$ for the left path, up to $180\deg$ for the right path. $90\deg$ therefore corresponds to the path ahead.
