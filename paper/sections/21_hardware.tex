\label{subsec:hardware}

From a hardware perspective, two main platforms are used: an arduino micro controller which captures the output from the sensors and a laptop, which processes the data.

\paragraph{Arduino}
This consists of an arduino Nano v.3, a MPU6050 used for its gyroscope sensor and a ultrasound transducer.

\paragraph{Laptop}
The arduino is connected via mini USB cable to a laptop, which provides the micro controller with power and receives and evaluates sensor data from it.
While this does not need to be a Laptop, for instance a Desktop computer or even a raspberry pi could be used instead, I will refer to this component as a Laptop in the following sections.
